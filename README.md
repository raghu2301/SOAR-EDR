# SOAR-EDR
## Overview
**SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** and **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** are two critical technologies in modern cybersecurity, working together to detect, respond to, and mitigate threats effectively.
</br>
</br>
## SOAR: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response

SOAR platforms are designed to help organizations manage and respond to security threats through a combination of orchestration, automation, and human-driven processes.

**Key Components of SOAR:**
1. **Orchestration:** Integration of various security tools and systems to streamline data sharing and workflows. SOAR centralizes information from diverse sources like firewalls, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools, and EDR solutions.
2. **Automation:** Reduces the manual workload of security teams by automating repetitive tasks, such as alert triaging, threat intelligence gathering, and incident prioritization.
3. **Response:** Provides tools and playbooks to help teams respond to incidents more effectively and consistently, with detailed guidance for decision-making.

**Benefits:**
- Faster threat response times.
- Reduced manual workload for security analysts.
- Improved efficiency and consistency in incident management.
- Enhanced threat visibility by correlating data from multiple sources.
</br>
</br>

## EDR: Endpoint Detection and Response

EDR solutions focus on monitoring and securing endpoints, such as workstations, servers, and mobile devices. These tools provide continuous endpoint visibility, detecting and responding to advanced threats.

**Key Features of EDR:**
1.	**Endpoint Monitoring:** Continuous collection of data from endpoints for suspicious activity.
2.	**Threat Detection:** Uses advanced analytics, machine learning, and behavior-based detection to identify threats like malware, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
3.	**Incident Response:** Enables security teams to isolate compromised endpoints, perform forensic analysis, and remediate threats.
4.	**Integration:** Often integrates with broader security ecosystems, including SOAR and SIEM platforms, for enhanced functionality.


**Benefits:**
- Rapid identification and containment of endpoint-based threats.
- Detailed forensic insights for post-incident analysis.
- Protection against zero-day and fileless attacks.
- Real-time visibility into endpoint activity.
</br>

## Synergy Between SOAR and EDR

While EDR excels at monitoring and securing endpoints, SOAR provides the orchestration layer to bring endpoint data together with broader security intelligence. By integrating EDR into a SOAR platform, organizations can:

1.	**Streamline Incident Response:** Automatically trigger response playbooks based on EDR alerts, reducing response times.
2.	**Enhance Threat Intelligence:** Combine endpoint data with network, cloud, and threat intelligence feeds for a comprehensive security posture.
3.	**Automate Routine Tasks:** Use SOAR to automate actions like quarantining infected endpoints detected by EDR.
4.	**Improve Analyst Efficiency:** Correlate endpoint data with other security events to provide context and prioritize critical threats.

</br>
</br>
</br>

## Objective 2: Writing rules for LimaCharlie
1. Generate telemetryon host machine using **lazagne**
2. Create detection and response rule.
   (Which we can send to tines for automation.)



- Goto [lagaZagne github page](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)
- Click on releases
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f8bfb00-0c2e-4313-86e0-627d37ed772b)

- Disable windows security
  Win security > Manage setting (virus and threat protection) > Disable real time protection
- Download laZane.exe from the github page.
- Goto Downloads folder
- And open powershell
- Run laZagnia.exe
```
.\laZagne.exe
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc1a907-021c-42e9-ac43-e2de1274a24b)

- Since we have run **laZagne** on our host, **LimaChalie** should have picked it up.
- Lets head to **LimaCharlie**
- Select **Sensor list**
- Select the **sensor** (host)
- Select **Timeline**
- Search **laZagne**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b56b159f-fa6c-4b24-805d-778d74afd931)

 It has many information, which will be useful in generating a detection the rule.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/254f1c96-a788-46bb-81c1-a9c13c76f385)


- Open a new tab
- Select our organization > Automation > D&R Rules > Create custom Rule
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2b32e59-088f-4327-8322-a50e1a7ccef0)

We donâ€™t need to build a rule from scrath.
- Goto github and find the [code](https://github.com/refractionPOINT/rules/blob/master/Sigma/dr_rules/windows_process_creation/win_process_creation_bitsadmin_download.yml)
- Click on RAW and copy the rules.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a9623e-c859-4812-9a32-49c80b46ceb9)

- Head back to the rules.
- Create a new rule and paste it.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a556a2-b308-440f-ae75-b86438e60cc4)

- We can see a **detect** and **respond** section in what we have copied.
  This essentially signifies two blocks.
  Starting from **respond** select all the text and cut paste it to the **respond** block.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4056c1cf-b088-4078-997b-b389c0414d3c)

Remove  the text **respond** from **respond block** and **detect** from **detect block.**
As it is just to specify the blocks.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d3d290a-7b2c-4f86-b121-7fcaabdd37ae)

Here:

**event:** specifies the event type, this process will only trigger if there is a new process or existing process.

**op:** specifies operator type here. 

It means the event type must be new process or existing process.
rules is going to the criteria this means we must follow the rules.
Op: is windows
Case sensitive is false
op is ends with (it is using 2 operators)
path   event/FILE_PATH
value lazagne.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03e0981b-3f66-4f89-83b1-c4e210f97593)

Here is the rule created for **detect** section
```
 events:
  - NEW_PROCESS
  - EXISTING_PROCESS
  op: and
  rules:
  - op: is windows
  - op: and
    rules:
    - case sensitive: false
      op: ends with
      path: event/FILE_PATH
      value: lazagne.exe
    - case sensitive: false
      op: ends with
      path: event/COMMAND_LINE
      value: all
    - case sensitive: false
      op: contains
      path: event/COMMAND_LINE
      value: lazagne
    - case sesitive: false
      op: is
      path: event/HASH
      value: '1c84c8632c5269f24876ed9f49fa810b49f77e1e92e8918fc164c34b020f9a94'

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d0711b-96f5-4360-b72c-5865128ac3a9)


Rule for **respond** section
```
- action: report
  metadata:
    author: raghu2301
    description: Detects lazagne (SOAR-EDR-TOOL)
    level: medium
    tags:
    - attack.credential_access
  name: raghu2301 - hacktool - Lazagne (SOAR-EDR)

```

The best thing of **LimaCharlie** is that we can test the configuration.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b7e1d93-03cb-437e-b559-8df99573a15e)
On left side we have a channel called alerts which I have created.
When we receive a detection from **LimaCharlie** on **Tines**. **Tines** will then send a message to **Slack** specifically within the alerts channel. Because as a **SOC Analyst** we would want to have a different channel and we want to have a dedicated channel for our alerts.

**Setting up Tines**
- Headover to [Tines website](https://www.tines.com/)
- Sign up if you are using it for first time
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7bfc6ea-0974-44e4-be60-b8cd9c813171)

- Click on Tines icon and create a New Story by clicking on **New**
<img width="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8476f791-a61b-40d6-b3bf-78a35ac9e722">


**Establishing connection**
Establish a link between **LimaCharlie** and **Tines** So that we can know **Tines** is retrieving the detection
For that we will be using **webhook**
**In Tines**
- Click and drag **Webhook** from the left side to the story board
- Copy the **Webhook url**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9c8f36-52d2-46fa-95f5-890f761eb97f)

</br>
</br>

## Objective 4: Creating a **Playbook** and its **Automation**

**Playbook Objective**
- Send a message to **Slack**
- Send a **email**
  (**email** will contain information about the detection that the LimaCharlie has generated)

- Generate a prompt:
  It will contain a message **Isolate the machine(yes/no)**
  If we select **yes** then **LimaCharlie** should automatically isolate the machine.

  In the workflow
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ff2912-0c49-4ff6-9c05-33e1b8f114e2)

We have the infected host with the detect hack tool that **LimaCharlie** has detected.
Which is pushed to **Tines.**
**Tines** is going to send a message to **Slack.** This means there should be a link between **Tines** and **Slack.**


To create a link between **Tines** and **Slack**
Goto **Slack** and look at the applications there.

</br>
</br>
</br>
Now we have to create a **Prompt** as per our workflow.
For **Prompt** we can use **page** which is under tools.
Drag **page** to the storyboard.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ce74cb9-0705-4e00-9152-90189c35d8a1)


Click on **Edit page.**
Lets include the details into the our messages.
For interesting fields we will goto our **Webhook.**
And expand detection > body

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a309b6f-b297-44cb-8dc3-7f26c2729724)

Open notepad.
Copy and paste the interesting fields.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d37935-4657-456f-8cc2-a556bf256269)

These details are only know to us, but it is not know to others, so lets make it more user friendly.

So we go to our **notepad** again and add the description before the links.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54b3f31a-33d1-4801-ab2c-b406d311f1fa)


Copy this and paste it again on the message, and replace the message which we had earlier.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/decafa67-bede-4326-8276-e49b04643fef)

Now we test it again.

Move to Slack.

Updated message will appear.

This time the details have descriptions. So that everyone can understand.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5ce8b2-0ba2-44a0-bd61-33d10dac9276)

</br>
</br>
</br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5368daa9-75b3-445c-93a0-1ac37c0f2adf)

We got the mail, but the formatting is not good.

So we open the html editor of the messages and make changes to break the line.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb48fc7-64d1-43b2-8faf-e96b960d9ad7)

And **test** the email again.
And check the mail again.
Now it looks good.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47cc2866-577a-4058-9e14-af5652513eac)
